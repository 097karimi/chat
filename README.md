# chat

# This project is going to be full feature social media which use react.js as a front-end and django as a back-end framework

# To do list:
- [ ] lovely first page to express our app to the user and let her sign up or login
- [ ] a page for user to be able to chat send emoji or send files
and more new idea which will come to my mind :tada:
